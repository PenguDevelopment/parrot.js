# Quick Start

`@ratinchat/parrot.js` depends on the following packages. Be sure to install these along with this package!

-   [`discord.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)

You can use the following command to install this package, or replace `npm install` with your package manager of choice.

```
npm install @ratinchat/parrot.js discord.js@14.x
```

## Initialize
To initialize your bot, use the following code:
```js
import parrot from '@ratinchat/parrot.js';

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const bot = new parrot.Bot({
    token: process.env.TOKEN,
    intents: ['Guilds', 'GuildMembers', 'GuildMessages', 'MessageContent']
});
```
In this example we use dotenv to hide our token. You can use any other method you want.  

!> In parrot.js you do not need to add a `client.login()` statement as it is already included in the bot.  

Feel free to change the intents as needed.  

---

## Text Commands
To initialize text commands, use the following code:

```js
const commands = bot.initCommands();
```
Bot takes an optional object with a prefix property.
```js
const commands = bot.initCommands({
    prefix: '!'
});
```
This adds a default prefix to all commands. 

?> Note: Prefixes set in the command will override this prefix.

To create a command, use the following code:
```js
commands.newCommand({
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Get the ping of the bot',
    execute: async (message) => {
        message.send("The ping is " + bot.getPing())
    }
});
```

---

## Importing Commands
You can import commands from other folders like this:
```js
parrot.ImportCommands(bot, './commands'); 
```
Make sure to change './commands' to your folder. (Use a relative path).  

!> The `bot` variable is the bot you created with `new parrot.Client`.

---

## External Commands
You can make external commands like this:
```js
import parrot from '@ratinchat/parrot.js';
```

In that folder you can create external commands like this:

```js
import parrot from '@ratinchat/parrot.js';

const command = new parrot.TextCommand({
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Get the ping of the bot',
    execute: async (message) => {
        message.send("The ping is " + bot.getPing())
    }
})
```

---

## Slash Commands
To initialize slash commands, use the following code:
```js
const interactionCommands = bot.initSlashCommands();
```
To create a slash command, use the following code:
```js
interactionCommands.newCommand({
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Ping the bot',
    execute: async (interaction) => {
        await interaction.reply("The ping is " + bot.getPing());
    }
});
```

---

## Importing Slash Commands

You can import slash commands from other folders like this:
```js
await parrot.ImportSlashCommands(bot, './SlashCmds');
```

---

## External Slash Commands

You can make external slash commands like this:
```js
import parrot from '@ratinchat/parrot.js';

const command = new parrot.SlashCommand({
    name: 'revive',
    description: 'Revive a user',
    execute: async (interaction) => { 
        await interaction.reply('Revived!');
    }
});

export { command };
```
You can register all the slash commands you have by running either:  
* Option 1:
```js
await interactionCommands.registerAll(process.env.TOKEN, bot);
```
* Option 2 (only if you have not run bot.initSlashCommands())
```js
await bot.initSlashCommands().registerAll(process.env.TOKEN, bot);
```

!> Make sure to run this after you have imported all your commands, or else it will not register all of them.

---

## Important Notes
There are a few new changes to parrot.js that have been made.  
* `message.channel.send` has been changed to `message.send`.
* `interaction.reply({ content: 'hi', ephemeral: true})` has been changed to `interaction.replyEphemeral('hi')`.
