# Special Functions

In parrot.js, there are some special functions that are either new or replace some functions in discord.js.

---

## interaction.replyEphemeral

This function is the same as `interaction.reply` but it sends an ephemeral message. You can use it like this:

```js
await interaction.replyEphemeral('This is an ephemeral message!');
```

---

## bot.setStatus

This function sets the bot's status. You can use it like this:

```js
bot.setStatus({ activities: [{ name: 'with parrot.js', type: "Playing" }], status: 'online' });
```

!> The type is case sensitive.
