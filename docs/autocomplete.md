# Autocomplete

To add autocomplete to your bot, add the autocomplete function to your slash command:

```js
import parrot from "@ratinchat/parrot.js";

const command = new parrot.SlashCommand({
  name: "why",
  description: "Why is the sky blue?",
  args: [
    {
      name: "response",
      description: "Why is the sky blue?",
      type: parrot.Options.String,
      autocomplete: true,
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  autocomplete: async (interaction) => {
    const focusedValue = interaction.options.getFocused(true);
    const answer = focusedValue.value;
    if (!answer) {
      return await interaction.sendAutocompleteResults([
        { name: "Please type something.", value: "No answer provided!!" },
      ]);
    }
    const choices = ["idk", "im not sure", "idrk", "how am i supposed to know"];
    const filtered = choices.filter((choice) =>
      choice.startsWith(focusedValue),
    );

    await interaction.respond(
      filtered.map((choice) => ({ name: choice, value: choice })),
    );
  },
  execute: async (interaction) => {
    const answer = interaction.options.get("response").value;
    await interaction.reply(`${answer} is incorrect!`);
  },
});

export { command };
```

Thats all you have to do!
