# Context Menus

Due to how context menus work, to initialize them you have to initialize slash commands.

To initialize slash commands, use the following code:

```js
const interactionCommands = bot.initSlashCommands();
```

To create a context menu, use the following code:

```js
interactionCommands.newContextMenu({
    name: 'test',
    type: parrot.ContextMenuType.User,
    execute: async (interaction) => {
        await interaction.reply({ content: 'Test', components: [] });
    }
});
```

## Context Menu Types

There are 3 types of context menus:

```js
parrot.ContextMenuType.ChatInput
parrot.ContextMenuType.User
parrot.ContextMenuType.Message
```

---

## Importing Context Menus

Due to the fact that context menus are handled just like slash command, you can just use the slash command importer.

```js
await parrot.ImportSlashCommands(bot, "./SlashCmds");
```

---

## External Context Menus

You can make external context menus like this:

```js
import parrot from '../../../GitHub/parrot.js/src/index.js'

const command = new parrot.ContextMenuCommand({
    name: 'wspgang',
    type: parrot.ContextMenuType.User,
    execute: async (interaction) => {
        await interaction.reply({ content: 'Wsp', components: [] });
    }
})

export { command };
```

!> In order for context menus to show in the apps category in discord you have to register them!

You can register all the context menus you have by running either:

- Option 1:

```js
await interactionCommands.registerAll(process.env.TOKEN, bot);
```

- Option 2 (only if you have not run bot.initSlashCommands())

```js
await bot.initSlashCommands().registerAll(process.env.TOKEN, bot);
```

!> Make sure to run this after you have imported all your commands, or else it will not register all of them.
